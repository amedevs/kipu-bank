The file toDoList.sol works like a task manager.
toDoList.sol has functions to create tasks, to get one (by its index), to mark one (by its index) and to delete one (by its description)

To deploy toDoList.sol, paste it on Remix IDE, compile it and go to 'Deploy & run transactions' (on left panel). In D&rt, set environment on 'Injected provider - MetaMask' (will open MetaMask and you will have to enter your personal password) and press Deploy.

To interact with the contract (after successfully deploying it), go to 'Deployed contracts' and click on the upper tag. There you will find fields to use the contract functions and manage a todo list.
